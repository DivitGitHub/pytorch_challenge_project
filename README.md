# Udacity Pytorch Challenge Final Project (Facebook Scholarship)

The challenge is to train a neural network with a given dataset to be able to identify 102 species of flowers. The dataset we be using to train our neural network is from University of Oxford which can be viewed [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).
## What I've used
- Python 3
- Pytorch 0.4.1
- torchvision
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Jupyter notebook
- Anaconda
